## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go 1.25 (single binary, `cmd/shellyctl/main.go`). The Go floor moved from 1.24 → 1.25 in v0.1.16 — gin v1.12.0 pulls `quic-go/quic-go` for HTTP/3, which requires Go 1.25.0 in its `go.mod`. CI's `setup-go` and the Dockerfile backend stage use the **Go 1.26 toolchain** (bumped in v0.3.4); the `go.mod` directive stays `go 1.25.0` — the floor — and the newer toolchain builds it backward-compatibly. **The binary links quic-go but does NOT open any UDP/QUIC listener** — the HTTP server in main.go is plain `net/http` over TCP. Phase 2 (v0.2.11) verified this; the QUIC code paths in the binary are dead weight at runtime, not an attack surface.
- **Frontend**: Svelte + TypeScript SPA (`web/src/`)
- **Database**: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (no CGO required)
- **Deployment**: Multi-stage Docker image — Node 26 builds frontend, Go 1.26 builds backend, Alpine 3.24 is the runtime (bumped from 3.23 in v0.5.5)
- **Entry point**: `cmd/shellyctl/main.go` → `internal/services/app.go`

The SPA is embedded into the Go binary at build time via `//go:embed`.

### Dependency-bump trap (lesson from v0.1.14 / v0.1.15)

A bump of gin or any `golang.org/x/{net,text,sync}` to its latest version can silently raise the `go` directive in `go.mod` past whatever CI is running. v0.1.14 hit this: dep bumps pushed `go.mod` to `1.25.0` while CI was still on Go 1.24, breaking the Test + Publish-Image workflows. Two-line check before any dep bump:

```bash
go list -m -f "{{if .GoVersion}}{{.GoVersion}} {{.Path}}@{{.Version}}{{end}}" all 2>/dev/null | sort -V -r | head -10
grep -E "^go " go.mod
```

If anything in the top of that list outranks `go.mod`'s directive, either bump CI/Dockerfile/go.mod together (the v0.1.16 path) or pick an older version of the offending dep.

### MCP server (HTTP + stdio, opt-in)

Lives in `internal/mcp/`. Two transports share the same 21-tool surface:

- **HTTP** (default for remote access): `cmd/shellyctl/main.go` starts a second listener on `:8081` (configurable via `SHELLYADMIN_MCP_PORT` / `SHELLYADMIN_MCP_BIND`) that speaks Streamable HTTP MCP. Token comes from one of two sources, resolved in this order: (1) `SHELLYADMIN_MCP_TOKEN` env var (operator override, always wins; via `services.DecodeSecretValue` so `_FILE` indirection works), (2) `AppSettings.MCPEnabled && AppSettings.MCPToken != ""` from the persisted settings (added in v0.1.20). When neither is set, the listener does not bind. Authenticated by the resolved token via either `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header **or** a URL whose first path segment IS the token (e.g. `http://host:8081/<token>/` — same shape Home Assistant uses, ergonomic for `mcp-remote`-style clients). Both checks run through `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`; the matched path prefix is stripped before reaching the SDK handler.
- **Stdio** (v0.2.3+, for Claude Desktop on the same host): `shellyctl mcp` subcommand. `cmd/shellyctl/mcp_stdio.go` opens the database, builds a minimal AppService (no background workers — query session, not server), and serves over `mcp.StdioTransport` via `internal/mcp.RunStdio`. No transport-level auth — the parent process spawning the binary IS the trust boundary; host filesystem permissions on the data dir are the remaining gate. Logs to stderr; stdout carries JSON-RPC frames. SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent readers if a long-running HTTP-mode container shares the same data dir.

- **Surface (v0.2.3)**: 21 tools. **13 read-only**: list_devices, get_device, list_device_actions, scan_status, firmware_status, firmware_install_status, list_templates, get_template, list_credentials, get_settings, get_logs, export_device, compliance_summary. **8 state-changing, all confirm-gated**: refresh_device, refresh_all_devices, start_scan, confirm_scan, firmware_check, firmware_install, execute_device_action, bulk_action. All thin adapters over `services.AppService`. Hard exclusion: anything that mutates ShellyAdmin's *own* config (save_settings, save_credential, save_template, provision, clear_logs).
- **`firmware_status` paging (v0.2.3)**: optional `status` / `has_update` / `search` / `limit` / `offset` inputs; output adds `filtered_total` (post-filter) and `returned` (post-page) alongside the unchanged `running` / `done` / `total` job-level metrics. Matters past ~200 devices where the unfiltered payload approaches MCP per-tool output caps.
- **Confirm-flow contract** (added v0.1.22, see `internal/mcp/tools_actions.go` `confirmPolicy`): every state-changing tool has a `Confirm bool` input. Without `confirm: true` the tool returns a typed preview (`SimpleActionResult.Preview=true` + per-tool fields like target counts, risk levels, per-target eligibility from `PreviewBulkAction`) and does NOT call the underlying AppService method. With `confirm: true` it executes. Each call audit-logs `mode=preview` or `mode=confirmed` so operators can pair them by request_id. `actionTool` wraps the context with `services.WithRisk(ctx, "low|medium|high")` so audit rows carry `risk_level`. The tool description includes a verbatim "OPERATOR APPROVAL REQUIRED" policy paragraph telling the LLM to summarize and ask before passing confirm=true.
- **Secret hygiene**: `list_credentials` and `get_settings` route through `internal/mcp/redact.go`. Plaintext password and HA1 hashes never leave the process via MCP. New fields with secret material must add a redactor before they're exposed.
- **Audit**: every tool call logs through `service.LogCtx(ctx, ...)`; `X-Request-ID` is honored on the request and echoed back. Audit rows show in `/api/logs` with `mcp ` prefix, filterable by request_id.
- **Why a separate port** (not `/mcp` on `:8080`): the MCP auth path stays off the cookie + CSRF middleware chain that protects the SPA, and an MCP listener bind failure is isolated from the main UI.
- **`scan_status` returns slim pending entries** (`{mac, ip, name, model, gen, app}` only, not full `models.Device`) — full payload was ~63 KB on a 44-device fleet and tripped MCP client output caps. The SPA shape is unchanged. If you add another tool that returns lists keyed off `models.Device`, follow the same pattern (`internal/mcp/tools.go` `slimScanPending` / `ScanPendingItem`).
- **Target resolution** for `get_device` / `list_device_actions` / `export_device` accepts MAC, IP, **or device name** (`services.GetDeviceDetail`). Don't reintroduce a MAC/IP-only check there — the tool descriptions advertise all three.
- **MCP token in settings is encrypted at rest** via `internal/core/secretbox`. `services.SaveSettings` seals; `services.GetSettings` opens. The API GET handler in `internal/api/handler.go` re-redacts to `services.MCPTokenRedacted` (`"<set>"`) before sending to the SPA. When the SPA round-trips settings unchanged, sending `"<set>"` back means "keep the existing token" (the magic value to preserve, not a literal token). Don't expose plaintext `MCPToken` over any new API surface — add a redactor first.
- **MCP listener lifecycle is live** as of v0.1.21. `services.AppService` owns an `*MCPController` (`internal/services/app_mcp.go`) holding the `*http.Server`. `SaveSettings` calls `ReconcileMCPFromSettings` after persisting, which serializes start/stop/rotate transitions on a controller-local mutex. Env-locked instances ignore reconcile. `cmd/shellyctl/main.go` injects `mcp.Build` as the builder via `SetMCPParams` to avoid a services↔mcp import cycle. `Stop(ctx)` tears the listener down before draining background workers. **One AppService is shared between main.go and the API handlers** via `api.Config.Service` — don't reintroduce a second `services.NewAppService(...)` inside the handler, the controller's live state would split.
- **`api.Config.Service`** is the way the api package consumes the shared AppService. When set, NewHandler reuses it; when nil, NewHandler still falls back to constructing its own (kept for tests that don't need to share state). main.go always sets it.

See [docs/adr/0011-mcp-read-only-server.md](./docs/adr/0011-mcp-read-only-server.md) for the full design rationale, the v0.1.22 state-changing tools addendum, and the v0.2.3 stdio + paging follow-up.

## Shelly Device Generations

Only Gen2+ devices are supported. Gen1 devices (HTTP REST / GET-based API) are not supported and will not be probed or provisioned.

| Gen   | Protocol                           | Endpoint |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Gen2+ | JSON-RPC 2.0 (POST with JSON body) | `/rpc`   |

Generation is detected via `GET /shelly` → `{"gen": N}`. Defaults to Gen2 if absent or zero.

---

## Shelly API Quirks

### Method-not-found error code

Shelly uses **non-standard JSON-RPC error code `404`** (not `-32601`) when a method is not supported on a specific device model. Example response:

```json
{ "error": { "code": 404, "message": "Not Found" } }
```

`isMethodNotFound()` in `provisioner.go` handles both `404` and `-32601` for safety.

### Firmware 2.0.0 auth — brute-force protection → `429`

Firmware **2.0.0** (2026-07-13) added device-side brute-force protection plus RFC-7616-compliant nonce management. Fleet operations (`bulk_action`, `refresh_all_devices`) run against a device with **wrong or stale credentials** can trip a per-device lockout, surfaced as HTTP `429 Too Many Requests`. No code fix is needed — `shellyclient` is already 2.0.0-shaped: RFC-7616 Digest with per-client nonce reuse + `nc` counter, a **stale-nonce retry** (re-parses the fresh challenge on a second 401, `client.go:316-358`), and `429` pass-through (`client.go:355`). Operational takeaway only: repeated wrong-credential attempts across the fleet will lock devices, so fix the credential before re-running a bulk job.

### Polling an in-flight OTA starves it — never touch a downloading device

**The single most expensive bug found in this repo so far (v0.5.6).** A Gen2+ device
downloading firmware buffers a ~3.6 MB image with almost no heap to spare (`hf≈62 KB`
free on a Gen3 at OTA start). Answering a concurrent `Shelly.GetDeviceInfo` RPC costs
enough of that heap to **stall the download — at 0%, silently, forever**. It does not
error, it does not abort, it just never progresses; the device stays healthy and on the
old version.

`installOne` used to poll `Shelly.GetDeviceInfo` every 5s *starting immediately after the
trigger*, so ShellyAdmin reliably killed the very update it was waiting for, then reported
`status="unknown"` / "device still on X after 5 min". Every ShellyAdmin-driven install
failed this way, while Shelly's cloud rollout and the device's own web UI succeeded —
neither polls.

Measured 2026-07-17 on two identical Plug Gen3s, same firmware, same trigger:

| Device | Polling | Result |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `.92` shelly-plug3-12 | none | `ota_progress` 0→100% in **2:25**, `ota_success`, rebooted onto 2.0.0 |
| `.59` shelly-plug3-08 | every 5s | `ota_progress` **0%, 0%, 0%, 0%** for 2.5 min, never moved |

The fix is the `FirmwareInstallQuietPeriod` knob (default 150s): after triggering, the job
leaves the device strictly alone, *then* polls. Nothing is lost by waiting — the version
cannot change until the device flashes and reboots. **Do not "optimise" the quiet period
away, and do not add any new device call (not even a cheap one) between the trigger and
the reboot.** The device's own OTA timeout is 3600s, so it is patient; we must be too.

**Diagnostic:** `curl -N http://<ip>/debug/log` streams the device's log as plain text over
HTTP — no config change, no MQTT/websocket detour. It carries `ota_begin` / `ota_progress` /
`ota_success` events and the resolved `fwcdn.shelly.cloud` URL, and is the fastest way to see
what an OTA is actually doing. Note the stream itself is an HTTP connection to the device —
useful for observing, but it means the log is not free either.

### Update availability is a version comparison, not a string compare

`firmware.IsNewer` (x/mod/semver, `internal/core/firmware/firmware.go`) decides
`Result.StableUpdate` / `BetaUpdate`. It must never go back to `!=`: a device on a beta sits
**ahead** of its model's stable channel, so string inequality advertises the older stable as
an available update. During the phased 2.0.0 rollout that mislabelled **36 of 44** fleet
devices (on `2.0.0-beta3`, offered stable `1.7.5` / `1.7.99-powerstripg4prod1` /
`1.8.99-plugmg3prod0`), and each triggered install was silently ignored by the device.

Shelly versions are semver-shaped, so prerelease < release gives `2.0.0-beta3 < 2.0.0`
correctly. Unparseable versions fall back to string inequality — an odd vendor string can
fail to suppress a downgrade, but can never *hide* a real update.

### OTA configuration on Gen2+ — implemented via `Schedule.*`, not `OTA.SetConfig`

The Shelly Gen2 API has **no `OTA.SetConfig` / `Sys.SetAutoUpdate` / dedicated OTA-config method**. The `OTA.*` methods that DO exist (`OTA.Start/Write/Data/Abort/Commit/Revert`) are byte-level chunked-upload plumbing, not configuration. Direct firmware update lives at:

- `Shelly.Update` — one-shot firmware update (requires `stage` param: `"stable"` or `"beta"`)
- `Shelly.CheckForUpdate` — check for available updates (returns BOTH `stable` and `beta` in one response)

**Auto-update is implemented as a Schedule entry.** The device's local web UI ("Enable auto update firmware", added in firmware 1.2.0) does NOT call a dedicated method. Instead it creates a `Schedule.*` job that calls `Shelly.Update` on a recurring timer with `origin: "shelly_service"` as the marker. ShellyAdmin reads/writes auto-update state through this same mechanism (see `internal/core/firmware/autoupdate.go`):

- **Read**: `Schedule.List` → filter for `calls[].origin == "shelly_service"` AND `calls[].method == "Shelly.Update"`. The `params.stage` field tells you `stable` or `beta`. Absent or disabled → `off`.
- **Set stable/beta**: `Schedule.Create` with `enable: true`, `timespec: "0 0 0 * * 0,1,2,3,4,5,6"` (cron-style; daily at midnight), `calls: [{method: "Shelly.Update", params: {stage: <stable|beta>}, origin: "shelly_service"}]`.
- **Disable**: `Schedule.Delete` for the matching job id.

Persisted on the Device row as `fw_auto_update` with values `""` (never read) | `off` | `stable` | `beta`. Read during every firmware check job. Bulk-settable via the Firmware page's "Auto → Off / Stable / Beta" buttons (action `set_auto_update`). Surfaced in compliance via the `auto_update_stage` rule.

### Alternative firmware variants — `sys.alt` (firmware 2.0.0+), read-only

Firmware 2.0.0-beta3 added an `alt` object: alternative firmware **variants** for the same hardware — a Zigbee or Matter build, or an add-on profile (e.g. Power Strip Gen4 → `PowerStripZB` "with Zigbee", Mini 1PM Gen4 → `Mini1PMG4ZB`, Pro 3EM → `Pro3EMProAddon`). It is a **map** keyed by variant id → `{name, desc, stable?{version,build_id}, beta?{version,build_id}}`, NOT a scalar third channel.

**Source is `Shelly.GetStatus` → `sys.alt`**, not `Shelly.CheckForUpdate` — a deliberate choice, not the only option: as of firmware **2.0.0 stable** (2026-07-13) the `alt` object *is* also carried in `Shelly.CheckForUpdate` (during the betas it lived only in sys status, so the earlier note that "CheckForUpdate stayed stable+beta only" is now outdated). We keep reading `sys.alt` because it's free — the scanner already fetches `Shelly.GetStatus` into `Device.RawStatus`, so **no extra RPC and no new DB column** — `sysAltVariants()` in `internal/services/actions.go` derives `Device.FWAlt []models.AltFirmwareVariant` from the cached RawStatus at `GetDevices()` time, exactly like `SwitchCount`. Surfaced in `/api/devices` (DeviceListView) + MCP `get_device`/`list_devices`, and as an `alt: <id>` badge in the Model cell of the Firmware page.

**Read-only, by design.** `Shelly.Update` accepts only `stage` (stable|beta) or `url` — there is **no `stage:"alt"`** and the alt object carries **no `url`**. So a variant/protocol switch (e.g. flashing a plug to Zigbee firmware) is NOT wired and can't be, with the currently documented API. ShellyAdmin only *shows* which devices could switch (useful for the ZHA fleet); the actual switch is done via the device's own web UI. If Shelly later documents an install path, wiring lives at the `TriggerUpdate*` seam in `internal/core/firmware/firmware.go`.

`sys.provisioning` (secure-provisioning state, same firmware) rides the same RawStatus read: `sysProvisioning()` → `Device.Provisioning map[string]any`, surfaced in `get_device`. Absent fleet-wide until a device is enrolled in secure provisioning.

Historical context: the `ota` provisioner section and an `ota_auto_update` compliance field that called `OTA.SetConfig` were **fully removed in v0.0.16** (the v0.0.14 removal was partial). If an `ota` block still appears in a user-supplied JSON template, it falls through to the catch-all handler (calls `Ota.SetConfig` → 404 → gracefully skipped).

### mqtt.ssl_ca valid values

The `mqtt.ssl_ca` field only accepts exactly four values:

- `""` / omitted — no TLS
- `"*"` — TLS, disable certificate validation
- `"ca.pem"` — TLS with built-in CA bundle
- `"user_ca.pem"` — TLS with user-uploaded CA certificate

### WS SSL CA

Same four-value pattern as MQTT: `""`, `"*"`, `"ca.pem"`, `"user_ca.pem"`.

| `gen2_rpc`    | arbitrary method map                                                                     |
| `gen1_http`   | skipped (legacy; Gen1 no longer supported)                                               |
| anything else | `<Capitalized>.SetConfig`                                                                |

Template variable substitution: `{device_name}` is replaced with the device's configured name (from `Shelly.GetConfig` → `sys.device.name`).

## Job Locking

Long-running jobs (refresh, scan, firmware_check) use a SQLite-backed status:

- `"running"` — job active
- `"done"` / `"failed"` — terminal
- `"interrupted"` — set on startup for any jobs stuck in `"running"` from a previous crash

A **stale-job guard** (2-minute timeout) prevents stuck `"running"` jobs from blocking manual triggers. Refresh jobs are **not** auto-restarted on startup (unlike scan/firmware_check) because they are user-initiated.

---

## Compliance Rules

Compliance rules in `models.ComplianceRules` are evaluated in `compliance.Evaluate()`. Key behaviors:

- `cloud_enabled` checks the device's cloud enable setting (distinct from `cloud_connected`)
- Custom rules support `source: device | config | status`, path traversal with `.`, operators: `eq` (default), `ne`, `contains`, `regex`, `exists`
- `{device_name}` token in rule values is substituted with the device's effective name

## Testability Pattern: OnClient Seams + Clock

Added in v0.1.15 (M3a). Each device-talking package (`internal/core/{scanner,firmware,setters}`) ships in two layers:

- **Public `…WithOptions` / `New(opts)` entry points** — production callers use these. They build a `*shellyclient.Client` from `Options` and delegate to the seam below. Behavior unchanged from before M3.
- **`…OnClient` seams** — accept a pre-built `*shellyclient.Client` directly. The precedent is `firmware/methods.go:30 ListSupportedMethodsOnClient`; v0.1.15 brought scanner / firmware / setters into line. Tests construct a `httptest.NewServer` fake-Shelly + a `shellyclient.Client` aimed at it, then call the OnClient variant.

`scanner.ProbeOptions` and `firmware.Options` carry an optional `Clock clock.Clock` field — nil falls back to `clock.Real()`. Tests inject `clock.NewFake(t)` + `Advance(d)` to pin timestamp-bearing fields (`LastSeen`, `AuthLockedUntil`, `CheckedAt`) to deterministic values.

When you add a new device-talking call site, follow the same pattern:

1. Public `…WithOptions` builds the client from `Options`.
2. Internal `…OnClient(ctx, client, …)` does the work.
3. Any wall-clock dependency goes through `clk.Now()`, not `time.Now()`.

The shared test fixture for firmware lives at `internal/core/firmware/helpers_test.go` (`fakeShelly` — per-method handler map, call recorder, defaults to the Shelly non-standard 404 RPC error for unregistered methods). Reuse it for new firmware tests.

## App Settings (operator-facing)

Defined in `models.AppSettings` (`internal/models/settings.go`), normalised on load via `Normalize()`. Notable knobs:

| Field                         | JSON key                         | Default     | Bounds      | Notes                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FirmwareInstallTimeout`      | `firmware_install_timeout`       | 600 (10 min) | `> 0`, and `≥ quiet + 150` | Per-device cap before install_job marks "unknown". Normalize forces the floor over the quiet period, which also repairs pre-v0.5.6 rows stuck at 300 |
| `FirmwareInstallQuietPeriod`  | `firmware_install_quiet_period`  | 150         | `[0, 600]` s | How long install_job leaves the device **completely alone** after the trigger. Load-bearing — see the OTA-starvation quirk above (v0.5.6)      |
| `FirmwareInstallPollInterval` | `firmware_install_poll_interval` | 5           | `[1, 60]` s | How often the install_job re-queries device firmware **after** the quiet period (added v0.1.13)                                               |
| `FirmwareCheckInterval`       | `firmware_check_interval`        | 0 (off)     | `≥ 0` s     | Periodic firmware_check job cadence; 0 disables the scheduler                                 |

The pattern for adding a new knob:

1. Field on `AppSettings` with JSON tag.
2. Default in `DefaultSettings()`.
3. Bounds clamp in `Normalize()`.
4. A `…FromSettings(s) <Type>` helper in the consuming service (see `firmwareInstallTimeoutFromSettings` / `firmwareInstallPollIntervalFromSettings` in `internal/services/app_jobs.go`).
5. Settings.svelte input — match `firmware_install_timeout`'s number-input shape unless a preset dropdown fits better.
6. TS field on `AppSettings` in `web/src/lib/types.ts`.

## Plaintext Password Removed

`SHELLYADMIN_PASS` (plaintext) was removed in **v0.2.0**. v0.0.15 added `_HASH` and started warning on plaintext use; v0.2.0 closed the deprecation window. The argon2id hash/verify in `internal/services/password.go` and the `shellyctl hash-password` subcommand remain — but as of first-run setup (below) `SHELLYADMIN_PASS_HASH` is no longer the *source of truth* for the login, only a one-time import seed.

---

## First-Run Setup — operator login in the DB (ADR-0017)

The operator login (username + argon2id hash) lives in the database, not the environment. See [docs/adr/0017-first-run-setup.md](./docs/adr/0017-first-run-setup.md).

- **Storage**: single-row `admin_credentials` table (migration 031), accessed via `db.{Get,Save,Clear}AdminCredential` and the service helpers in [internal/services/app_auth.go](internal/services/app_auth.go). NOT in `AppSettings` (which is mirrored to the SPA via `GET /api/settings` — a hash must never go there). The PHC hash is one-way, so it is stored verbatim, NOT secretbox-sealed.
- **Resolution**: the login handler resolves the credential at request time via `h.adminCredential()` ([internal/api/handler.go](internal/api/handler.go)) — DB first, then a `cfg.User`/`cfg.PassHash` fallback kept so handler tests that seed `Config` (not the DB) still pass. The lockout/TOTP keys use the *resolved* username.
- **Boot ([cmd/shellyctl/main.go](cmd/shellyctl/main.go))**: the old "panic when `SHELLYADMIN_PASS_HASH` is empty" is GONE. `ImportEnvCredentialOnce(user, passHash)` imports a still-present env hash into the DB exactly once (only when no DB credential exists) — seamless upgrade for existing deployments. With no credential at all the server logs a setup-mode warning and boots anyway.
- **Setup mode**: no credential ⇒ the SPA renders the public setup screen (`/setup`) gated by `GET /api/setup/status` → `{configured: bool}`. `POST /api/setup` is the **only unauthenticated mutation** — public, rate-limited, one-shot (409 once configured), race-guarded by a service mutex + the single-instance lock.
- **Change later**: `POST /api/account/credentials` (authenticated, **cookie-only** — a PAT cannot rotate the login that gates it). Verifies the current password, updates, then revokes all sessions (SPA redirects to `/login`). UI: `web/src/pages/settings/AccountCard.svelte`.
- **Recovery**: `shellyctl reset-auth --force` clears the row → next boot is setup mode again (mirrors `shellyctl unlock --force`). This is the forgotten-password path now that env is no longer authoritative.
- The encryption-key requirement (next section) is unaffected and still enforced — setup mode still needs `SHELLYADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

---

## Encryption Key Required (v0.3.0)

S6 from the consolidated review (ADR-0013) closed the encryption-key auto-generation path in v0.3.0. The boot path's `loadEncryptionKey()` in [cmd/shellyctl/main.go](cmd/shellyctl/main.go) refuses to start when neither `SHELLYADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` nor `SHELLYADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` is set. v0.2.11 added the deprecation warning; v0.3.0 turned it into a hard error.

Migration recipe for operators upgrading from v0.2.x with an auto-generated `{dataDir}/shellyadmin.key`: copy the file contents to a path outside the data volume (Docker secret, NixOS secret store, sops-encrypted file in the homelab config repo), then set `SHELLYADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE=/path/to/it` in the compose `.env`. The startup error message includes the legacy path when it's detected, so the recovery is one `cat` away.

Threat closed: a volume snapshot exfiltrating both the encrypted credentials in `shellyctl.db` AND the key file sitting next to it — defeated the at-rest encryption entirely. External key management = both halves no longer share a backup boundary.

**Key rotation (v0.5.3)**: `shellyctl rotate-key` re-seals every secretbox blob — credentials, credential groups, TOTP material, the MCP token inside the settings JSON — in ONE transaction (`internal/db/rotate.go` `RotateSealedColumns`). Old key from `SHELLYADMIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY[_FILE]`, new key from `SHELLYADMIN_NEW_ENCRYPTION_KEY[_FILE]`; without `--force` it's a dry run that verifies the old key opens everything. Writes a timestamped DB backup before applying; refuses while a fresh runtime-lock heartbeat exists (live server). Explicit-key seal/open variants: `secretbox.{Seal,Open}StringWithKey`. **A new sealed column anywhere must be added to `RotateSealedColumns`**, or rotation silently leaves it orphaned under the old key.

---

## Single-Instance Constraint (ADR-0015, v0.3.0)

The 030 migration adds a `runtime_locks` table; [internal/services/runtimelock](internal/services/runtimelock/runtimelock.go) claims the `primary` row at startup, runs a 60s heartbeat, and releases on graceful shutdown. A second container starting against the same SQLite file finds a fresh row and refuses to boot — the error names the foreign hostname/pid + when the row will go stale.

A stale row (5+ minutes without heartbeat — covers `kill -9`'d previous container) is silently overwritten. Operators who don't want to wait the staleness window can run `shellyctl unlock --force` to clear the row manually.

Why: process-local state (rate-limit map, MCP listener, background workers) doesn't replicate across instances. Two containers reading the same DB would double-spawn the firmware-check scheduler, race audit-log retention, and try to re-bind `:8081`. The lock is the explicit door-closer for that misconfiguration.

## TOTP 2FA + Personal Access Tokens (Block 4c, v0.3.0)

Two new operator-facing auth surfaces, both built on the existing server-side session store (S5):

**TOTP 2FA (T1)** — operator enrolls a TOTP secret via the Settings UI; subsequent logins require a 6-digit code in addition to the password. RFC 6238 stdlib impl in [internal/services/totp/totp.go](internal/services/totp/totp.go); 10 single-use backup codes issued at enrollment (sha256-hashed + secretbox-sealed in the DB row); wrong code bumps the same per-account lockout counter as wrong-password. [internal/api/handler_totp.go](internal/api/handler_totp.go) drives the `/api/totp/{status,enroll,verify-enroll,disable}` surface.

**Personal Access Tokens (T3)** — bearer-token credentials for headless callers (Home Assistant, cron, scripts) so `/api/*` mutations don't have to fake the cookie + CSRF dance. Token format `pat_<8hex id>_<64hex random>`. Scope catalog (`admin`, `devices:read/write`, `firmware:read/write`, `provision`, `settings:read/write`) gated per-route via `middleware.RequireScope`. Bearer-authed requests skip CSRF (the token IS the proof-of-intent). [internal/services/tokens/tokens.go](internal/services/tokens/tokens.go) is the orchestration; [internal/middleware/auth.go](internal/middleware/auth.go) extends RequireAuth to honor the `Authorization: Bearer pat_…` header. PAT-authed callers cannot mint, list, or revoke other PATs (privilege-escalation guard at the handler).
